##Date 15th April

#Folders and filename appropriate - nicely done
#Assignment not complete it should have two pages
#Assignment is missing the complete requirements such as grid layout of 8 and 4 and reverse - no social media icons
#Comments in HTMl - quite good however could not find the same in the CSS File
#Code indented in HTML - but was not done in the case of CSS
#Except for Header and Nav - the rest of the page is not coming properly
#The order of CSS linking is incorrect - it should 1. reset 2. 960 and/or text and last should be your own CSS - otherwise it gets overwritten
#The page is not neatly done - can be better
